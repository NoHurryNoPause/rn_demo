Alternatively, you can press "open project in the browser" in order to have a window open that will run a simulated device

1. run `yarn install`
2. run `expo start` | `yarn start`
3. Localhost:199002 will be opened in a browser at which point you'll be able to open on a simulator or physical device

About expo
